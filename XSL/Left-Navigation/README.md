Left Navigation Sample
======================

This is used to generate 5 tree navigation blocks: about, departments, students, community, employees

These are loaded dynamically based on current URL.

I also have a dynamic metadata checkbox called "excludeSitemap" which excludes all children of a folder from the tree.
